7/30/23, 11:16 in the morning - ðŸš€Carlos Loor: Good morning @SAIA Roberto AlcÃ­var, my apologies for bothering you at this time in the morning, 
but I believe there might have been some issue with the API or perhaps with the server that handles it, as it stopped working about 15 minutes ago. 
Could you please inform us what just happened or what steps we should take?
7/30/23, 11:55 in the morning - ðŸš€Carlos Loor: @SAIA Roberto AlcÃ­var, I'm sending you another message just to update you on the sequence of events. 
I don't know what happened, but the API is functioning correctly now.
7/30/23, 1:13 in the afternoon - SAIA Roberto AlcÃ­var: Hi, good day.
7/30/23, 1:13 in the afternoon - SAIA Roberto AlcÃ­var: Okay.
